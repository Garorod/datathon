1. Data came from https://www.kff.org/report-section/state-covid-19-data-and-policy-actions-sources/
AND https://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-2020/states-mask-mandates-coronavirus.html#Alabama
AND states' website

2. However, there were a lot of conflict in the date.

3. Table schema 
** maskDate1 --> the first date that mask requirement/mandate
** isMaskRequired1 --> 0 == requirement | 1 == mandate  
** maskDate2, isMaskRequired2, maskDate3, isMaskRequired3 --> same as previous

#### First mandate policy ####
** schoolClosure_m1 --> Close school and/or education institute 
** banGathering_m1 --> Ban social gathering 
** resturantLimit_m1 --> Suspend resturant and/or take out only (some states classify BAR as resturant) 
** stayAtHome_m1 --> Encourage to stay at home 
** nonEssenBussiness_m1 --> Close of all nonessential bussiness  
** travelQuarantine_m1 --> international/interstate travellers require to quarantine themself  
** barClosure_m1 --> Close of bar  
 
#### First easing policy #### --> poor data quality
** schoolClosure_e1 --> Reopen of schools (rarely)
** banGathering_e1 --> Ease social gathering 
** resturantLimit_e1 --> Allow dine in (outside only)
** stayAtHome_e1 --> Not many states have this "Stay at home" easing order. It seems that this data is not available in most states.
** nonEssenBussiness_e1 --> Reopen of non essential bussiness 
** travelQuarantine_e1 --> Lift quarantine restrictions 
** barClosure_e1 --> Reopen bar

#### Second mandate policy #### --> More pore
same as previous

#### Second easing policy ####
same as previous
